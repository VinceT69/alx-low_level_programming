### Read

- Read (again) through [Everything you need to know to start with C](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ghto-TsXqgPRuEVmiCp7GvGttobdTLF4Yq8IRXwzvHY/edit#slide=id.p). You do not have to learn everything in there yet, but make sure you read it entirely first and make sure you understand the slides: “comments”, “Data types | Integer types”, “Declaration”, “Characters”, “Arithmetic operators”, “Affectations”, “Comparisons”, “Logical operators”, “if, if...else”, “while loops”.
- Read or watch [Keywords and identifiers](http://publications.gbdirect.co.uk/c_book/chapter2/keywords_and_identifiers.html), [integers](http://publications.gbdirect.co.uk/c_book/chapter2/integral_types.html), [Arithmetic Operators in C](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cprogramming/c_arithmetic_operators.htm), [If statements in C](http://www.cprogramming.com/tutorial/c/lesson2.html), [if...else statement](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cprogramming/if_else_statement_in_c.htm), [Relational operators](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cprogramming/c_relational_operators.htm), [Logical operators](http://fresh2refresh.com/c-programming/c-operators-expressions/c-logical-operators/), [while loop in C](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cprogramming/c_while_loop.htm), [While loop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju1LYO9pkaI).
- man [ascii](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/ascii.7.html) and every other man seen previously.
- You do not need to learn about scanf, getc, getchar, EOF, EXIT_SUCCESS, time, rand, srand, RAND_MAX, for loops, do...while loops, functions.
